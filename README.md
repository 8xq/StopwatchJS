# StopwatchJS
This is a very simple stopwatch made with JS , has 3 simple functions such as (start stopwatch , stop stopwatch , reset stopwatch)
This project was simply made to get more comfortable with intervals and timers within JS.

## Plans
+ Add some sounds on button clicks
+ Add "Hours" to the stop watch
